Challange :- You work for an online fruit store, and you need to develop a system that will update the catalog information with data provided by your suppliers. When each supplier has new products for your store, they give you an image and a description of each product.

Given a bunch of images and descriptions of each of the new products, youâ€™ll:

    Upload the new products to your online store. Images and descriptions should be uploaded separately, using two different web endpoints.
    Send a report back to the supplier, letting them know what you imported.
